## Introduction 
This data project was a project that I completed as part of my course work at University. The purpose of the assignment was to undertake a data wrangling project that involved to combine two datasets in different forms, into one dataset that would allow us to gain insights and answer questions.

## Overview

**Summary of the project**
- I chose to combine a dataset on details of Olympic Medals (in .csv format) and a dataset on GDP of countries across years (in JSON format).
- Through various data wrangling techniques, I was able to combine the dataset into a final format of an Excel workbook using a year/country combination as the common variable to link the data.
- Each of the 19,986 rows of the final dataset record details of a medal won and a GDP value according to the year and country of the athlete.
- The data in this form allowed me to use Pivot tables and charts to answer three questions I had posed before my wrangling journey; firstly whether there is a trend between the medal count and average GDP across countries, whether the changing GDP across years affects the medal count for a country and lastly if a higher GDP correlates to a specific type of medal.  

The following report details my wrangling journey, including successes and failures.
